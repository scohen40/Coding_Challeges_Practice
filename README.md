## Overview

Within this repository, each challenge has its designated folder. 
Within each folder there is a file for my solution(s) and a file for the solution(s) given for reference ( I usally hide the given solution(s) until I have completed my own or reached a roadblock).
My solution files include:
* a clear description of the problem statement with relevant examples
* my plan(s) and/or solution(s) with comment documentation
* sometimes notes on the nuances of the problem, reflections on the solution(s) approach(es), the runtime(s), or the functionality/lackthereof of each attempt.

## Languages and Environments

The majority of the solutions are crafted in Python and SQL. However, there might be occasional solutions in other languages depending on the specific requirements or my explorative endeavors.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

Replace `your-github-username` and `your-repo-name` with the appropriate values.

## Usage

To run a specific solution:

```bash
cd directory-of-challenge
command-to-run e.g., python filename.py
```

Ensure that you have the necessary compilers or environments set up to execute the code.


## Challenges

- **[Excel Column Number](https://github.com/scohen40/Coding_Challeges_Practice/tree/main/Excel_Column_Number)**: convert an iteger of base-10 to equivalent Excel column number of base-26
