# Write a function called word_count
## take in a single argument, a string of arbitrary length
## output a dictionary with a count of each occurance of every word
## ensure that case is not taken into account, as in "the" and "The" should both count as "the"


## input: "dog dog cat cat"
## output: {"dog": 2, "cat": 2}

## input: "red Fish blue fish one Fish two fish"
## output: {"red": 1, "fish": 4, "blue": 1, "one": 1, "two": 1}

## input: "I remember I put on my socks, I remember I put on my shoes. I remember I put on my tie That was printed In beautiful purples and blues. I remember I put on my coat, To look perfectly grand at the dance, Yet I feel there is something I may have forgotâ€” What is it? What is it?.." (Shel Silverstien)
## output: {'i': 10, 'remember': 4, 'put': 4, 'on': 4, 'my': 4, 'socks,': 1, 'shoes': 1, 'tie': 1, 'that': 1, 'was': 1, 'printed': 1, 'in': 1, 'beautiful': 1, 'purples': 1, 'and': 1, 'blues': 1, 'coat': 1, 'to': 1, 'look': 1, 'perfectly': 1, 'grand': 1, 'at': 1, 'the': 1, 'dance': 1, 'yet': 1, 'feel': 1, 'there': 1, 'is': 3, 'something': 1, 'may': 1, 'have': 1, 'forgot': 1, 'what': 2, 'it': 2}






# // tip: probably separate this into 2 functions (one for cleaning, one for the algorithm)
